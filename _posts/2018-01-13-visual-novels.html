<p>It can be hard to get started with visual novels, so here are some of my recommendations. I hope you'll find at least one you enjoy!</p>
<p>I tried to include a variety of genres, lengths, and overall "anime" levels... if you know what I mean. </p>
<p>Although most of these games have an anime art style, I stayed away from games with extremely "weeabo" plots, except for Steins;Gate which uses this as a plot device. </p>

<p>A group of college friends with their own laboratory accidentally create a functioning time machine using a cell phone and a microwave. 
    Now a worldwide conspiracy will do anything to hunt them down and take control of the future. </p>

<h3>Quick Sell:</h3>
<p>Probably one of the most well known big name visual novels - it's not only well rated by visual novel fans but it also spawned a really popular (and excellent) anime. </p>
<p>I'm a bit of a sucker for unreliable narrators in visual novels, and this is a great example. Some readers may be put off by his wacky anime antics in the beginning, but the story gains direction as it goes on.</p>
<p>The standard for visual novels is to give players choices by letting them click on one of a few text options on the screen. Steins;Gate cleverly uses the main character's 
    in-universe cellphone as a more integrated way to impact the direction of the story. I'm interested to see how creators can explore interactivity like this more in the future.

<p>Junpei wakes up suddenly on a sinking ship with a group of eight strangers. Now he has nine hours to escape and survive the deadly "Nonary Game".</p>

<h3>Quick Sell:</h3>
<p>The beginning of my favorite <b>Zero Escape</b> series, there's not only a mind-bending story but also a lot of gameplay in the form of room escape puzzles. </p>
<p>Games like this often suffer from the story taking a really long time to pick up - not this one.</p>
<p>You should know in advance that players are expected to play through the game multiple times to get to the <b>true ending</b> of the story that wraps up the plot in a satisfying way. 
    If you make it to an ending that doesn't answer your questions - don't give up! A text skip feature makes it easier to play again while making different choices. 
</p>
<p>Some aspects of the puzzles and story events play out much better on the DS / 3DS version, so I'd strongly recommend getting that version unless you don't own one. </p>

<p>In an apocalyptic earth, a survivor scavenging for supplies stumbles upon an android that has been faithfully waiting to perform her job as a planetarium host for decades. </p>

<h3>Quick Sell:</h3>
<p>A short but cute and bittersweet game, this is a good entry into the "crying game" genre of visual novels meant to tug on your heartstrings just like a drama movie.</p>
<p>This is what visual novel fans call a <b>kinetic novel</b> - it has no choices and only one ending.</p>

<p>You are a space investigator sent to determine what happened to the Mugunghwa, a massive Korean spaceship meant to set up a new colony in the stars. All aboard are long gone - read through the ships logs alongside its personified AI to understand what happened on board the ship long ago. </p>

<h3>Quick Sell:</h3>
<p>Have to have at least one non-Japanese recommendation on this list. This game's UI is particularly noteworthy as it fits into the story perfectly.</p>
<p>I really like how there's an in-universe explanation for why you are reading all of the text in the game. While it is a visual novel, most of the plot takes place in the 
    text of the ship's logs only, which is a really unique twist.

<p>As a defense attorney look for evidence and work with a really over-the-top cast of characters in the courtroom to find the truth behind multiple murder cases. </p>

<h3>Quick Sell:</h3>
<p>This game was a surprise smash hit on the original DS. I don't think many people expected this style of game to be so popular in the west - I like to think its success is part of the reason 
    why publishers take more risks on text-based games today.</p>
<p> The translation of the Phoenix Wright series has been somewhat divisive for really hardcore fans because of how much changed for the localization, but that brings its own charm in my opinion. </p>
<p> While the whole package of five episodes together make a medium length game, each episode tells a satisfying story that can be completed in a few sittings.</p>

<p>Inside a cursed mansion, a mysterious maid leads you on a voyage through the tragedies that have occured there throughout the years...</p>

<h3>Quick Sell:</h3>
<p>For a big change of pace - this game tells a set gothic, tragic, bleak short stories that tie together in the end all illustrated with a very unique art style.</p>
<p>The music is the real star of this game. The friend who recommended this game to me mentioned that the game itself is just an excuse to show off the music. You decide.</p>

<p>You are a summoned fire elemental, bound to serve as a firewall. Protect your summoners from technological / magical threats - or don't.</p>

<h3>Quick Sell:</h3>
<p>Another non-Japanese recommendation. I really like how many possible endings there are and it was fun to try to see them all. </p>
<p>This game tells a simple but interesting story with extremely minimal graphics and sound effects making it a lot more like old-school "interactive fiction" stories. 
    It has a completely different feel from everything else on this list, and you'll probably make it to the end in one sitting.
